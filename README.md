# dante

if you'd like to be able to control the bot, you can do so, however, i need to make the code detect when you specifically post, so I need to know your name (nothing else) in order for it to work. all you need to do is click the link below and enter your first and last name (capitalization matters) and click submit, and the code for dante will be automatically revised so that you can control it. 

you can see the form here: https://ezekiel.deblois.me/dante-form.html
